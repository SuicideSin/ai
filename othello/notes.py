'''
Othello boards are 8x8 grids

X = black
O = white

black goes first.

Specs:

Othello Program

Input schemes:
    If "othello", you vs computer

    If "othello 2", then its you vs friend

    If "othello board", then print out a board

    If "othello x (or o)", then print move
        A move is an index on the string for which the program will place an object
        The moderator will take the last printed move as the move (so that you can use as much time as you can)
            Othello is not a solved program, no program can play othello perfectly
        Printing a "P" means pass.
