'''
1. Read in the words from ghost.txt, argument to script indicates number of players (default is two)
2. Implement a keystroke monitor-- process is different for windows, mac, and linux -- perhaps make a class that is ready for any system (use sys.platform)
    > CAT
    Keystroke monitor!! Enter key doesn't get pressed
4. A number indicates a challenger number
     Script will adjudicate the challenge
     Will output the loser in the scenario, adds to player's ghost, restarts
5. A period will cause the script to show all possible available letters on the next line that could be played that. If dot is inputted and there are no available letters, game ends with no loser
    ex:
        > cat.
        ... s, h, t, a, e, f
        > cat    #waiting for next input
